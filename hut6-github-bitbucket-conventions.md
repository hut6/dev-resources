# Github and Bitbucket Conventions

## Public stuff

We use public repositories in GitHub for any resources that are available to public, general utility resources, procedures or to make contributions to open source projects. 

Anything confidential needs to stay out of any public repositories on GitHub.

## Repository Naming Convention

To make sure we use consistent names, repositories will be named like so: the year the project is started, the business name (in one word), then the project type (in one word), separated by dashes, everything in lower case. eg "2014-business-website".

If there happen to be two distinct projects in the same year for the same client, add a label at the end like so: "2014-business-newsletter-promotion" and "2014-business-newsletter-mediarelease".
