# Password Tips 

Some general tips 

--- 

## Using the password manager

Install the [browser extensions](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/extensions) to save time use the shortcut Command+\ to open the password manager any time you need it. 

If your password manager doesn't automatically fill out the form and doesn't list any entries, search your vault before asking someone else. It's possible that the domain has changed for a certain site (eg when a site in dev is made live, etc...).

## New passwords

Don't come up with new passwords yourself. Use a different and strong password for every site. Use caps, number and special characters and don't worry about making it too long (you don't have to remember it anyway, that's what password managers are for).

## Saving passwords

Only passwords that need to be shared should be saved in the password manager. Please don't put your personal passwords for eg. Gmail, Xero or iCloud in the password manager for everyone to see unless you have your own personal vault in addition to the shared vault. 

The make sure you save passwords to the right vault if there are multiple vaults. 

When saving the password for a site in the password manager, use this format for the description field: 

```domain.com (username)```

If the site doesn't use the default port (eg for WHM, CPanel), specify the port as well: 

```domain.com:2087 (username)```

or 

```domain.com:whm (username)```

If a password is out of date in the password manager, or if it's already in there but the password manager asks you to save a new entry, make sure you replace or delete the old entry when saving the password. 

## Domain Changes

Please update the domain when a domain name is changed (eg when a site is launched).

## Autos vs. Manual Save

Autosave can be annoying as it's displayed often, and there's a chance you might save passwords that don't belong in the password manager. It's recommended that you disable it and instead save your passwords manually. 

You can also use Manual Save to save complex web forms.

## Other Tips

If in doubt about a site’s security, use OAuth (ie, use Google, Facebook or other to sign in instead of entering your password).
